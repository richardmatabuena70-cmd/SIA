## 🔄 User Journey Through Code

### 1. User Registers
```
index.html 
  ↓ (fill form)
script.js → registerForm.submit()
  ↓ (validate)
js/api.js → registerUser()
  ↓ (HTTP POST)
server.js → POST /api/register
  ↓ (insert user)
database.sql → users table
  ↓ (success)
script.js → showLogin()
```

### 2. User Logs In
```
index.html
  ↓ (fill form)
script.js → loginForm.submit()
  ↓ (send credentials)
js/api.js → loginUser()
  ↓ (HTTP POST)
server.js → POST /api/login
  ↓ (check database)
database.sql → find user
  ↓ (return token)
js/api.js → save to localStorage
  ↓ (redirect)
dashboard.html
```

### 3. User Takes Quiz
```
dashboard.html → chooseLevel()
  ↓ (select difficulty)
js/quiz.js → startQuiz(level)
  ↓ (generate questions)
generateQuestions()
  ↓ (display)
renderQuestion()
  ↓ (answer each question)
selectAnswer() → nextQuestion()
  ↓ (complete all 10)
finishQuiz()
  ↓ (calculate score)
saveScoreToDatabase()
  ↓ (HTTP POST)
server.js → POST /api/save-score
  ↓ (insert score)
database.sql → quiz_scores table
  ↓ (show results)
renderQuestion() → Game Over Screen
```

### 4. User Views Scores
```
dashboard.html → showScores()
  ↓ (get user from localStorage)
js/dashboard.js
  ↓ (check history)
user.history array
  ↓ (display HTML)
renderQuestion()
```

## 🎯 Key Concepts Explained Simply

### Configuration (js/config.js)
- **What:** Central place for all settings
- **Why:** Easy to change values without editing code logic
- **Example:** Change TOTAL_QUESTIONS: 10 to make 20-question quizzes

### API Functions (js/api.js)
- **What:** Functions that talk to backend
- **How:** Use `fetch()` to send HTTP requests
- **Why:** Separates API logic from UI logic

### State (localStorage)
- **What:** Data stored on user's computer
- **Where:** Can access from DevTools → Application → Storage
- **Why:** Persists even after closing browser

### DOM Manipulation
- **What:** Changing HTML content with JavaScript
- **How:** Use `innerHTML = "<html>"` to render content
- **Why:** Makes UI dynamic and responsive

### Event Listeners
- **What:** Code that runs when something happens
- **How:** `.addEventListener("event", function)`
- **Examples:** 
  - "submit" when form submitted
  - "click" when button clicked

## 💻 Running the Application

### Step 1: Start Database
```bash
# Make sure MySQL is running
mysql -u root -p
```

### Step 2: Start Server
```bash
cd "Final Project in SIA"
npm start
# Or: npm run dev (with auto-restart)
```

### Step 3: Open Browser
```
http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 4: Test
1. Register new account
2. Login with credentials
3. Take a quiz
4. Check scores on dashboard
5. View other users' scores

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### Check if Backend is Running
```bash
# Terminal should show: "Server running on http://localhost:5000"
```

### Check Browser Console
- Right-click → Inspect → Console tab
- Look for errors in red

### Check Network Requests
- Inspect → Network tab
- Take quiz, should see POST requests to /api/save-score

### Check Local Storage
- Inspect → Application → Storage → Local Storage
- Should see `authToken` and `currentUser` after login

### Check Database
```sql
-- In MySQL terminal
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM quiz_scores;
```

## 📊 Data Flow Diagram

```
USER INTERFACE (HTML)
    ↓
LOGIC LAYER (JavaScript)
    ↓
API LAYER (fetch to backend)
    ↓
SERVER (Express.js)
    ↓
DATABASE LAYER (MySQL queries)
    ↓
DATABASE (MySQL)
```

### Example Flow:
```
User clicks "Login" (index.html)
    ↓
Triggers form submit (script.js)
    ↓
Calls loginUser() (js/api.js)
    ↓
Sends POST /api/login (HTTP)
    ↓
Backend processes request (server.js)
    ↓
Queries users table (database.sql)
    ↓
Returns user or error
    ↓
Frontend stores token (localStorage)
    ↓
Redirects to dashboard
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Login/Register with email and password
- ✅ Passwords stored in database
- ✅ Basic validation on frontend

### For Production (Not implemented)
- ❌ Passwords should be hashed (use bcrypt)
- ❌ Need JWT tokens instead of dummy tokens
- ❌ Need HTTPS instead of HTTP
- ❌ Need rate limiting on login attempts

## 🎓 Learning Points

### What Makes Good Code
1. **Comments** - Explain WHY not WHAT
2. **Configuration** - Centralize settings
3. **Separation of Concerns** - API separate from UI
4. **Error Handling** - Check for errors, show messages
5. **State Management** - Track data consistently

### Design Patterns Used
1. **Module Pattern** - Organize code in files
2. **Observer Pattern** - Event listeners
3. **MVC Pattern** - Model (data), View (HTML), Controller (logic)
4. **API Pattern** - Frontend-Backend communication

## 📞 For During Defense

### If Asked "How does X work?"

**Q: How does login work?**
A: User enters credentials, frontend sends to backend API, backend queries database, returns token, token stored in localStorage for authentication.

**Q: How does quiz generation work?**
A: generateQuestions() creates 10 random problems based on difficulty level, generates 3 answer choices (1 correct + 2 wrong), shuffles them.

**Q: How are scores saved?**
A: After quiz completes, finishQuiz() calculates correct answers, saves to localStorage (offline), calls API to save to database (persistent).

**Q: How does timer work?**
A: startTimer() uses setInterval to run every 1 second, decrements timer, if reaches 0 automatically calls finishQuiz().

**Q: How are colors managed?**
A: APP_CONFIG.COLORS has all color values, updateTextColors() reads current theme and applies colors to all elements.

### If Asked "What would you improve?"

1. **Security**: Use bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for tokens
2. **Database**: Add more constraints, indexes for performance
3. **UI**: Add animations, loading states
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests for functions
5. **Error Handling**: More specific error messages
6. **Mobile**: Make responsive for phones
